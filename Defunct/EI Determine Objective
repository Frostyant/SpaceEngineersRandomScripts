//Economic Infrastucture Script

//okay so the standard info format is :
//"role" of this section (in number format);number of "energy modules";number of "cargo modules";number of "specialized modules";integrity in percentage
//subject to change though
//the config info format is :
//;"role",price of energy modules , price of cargo modules , price of specialized modules , ratio of energy , ratio of cargo , ratio of specialized , 
//Maximal demand per specialized module
//

//Types of planned modules :
//Ressource Gatherings defined by string : "0"  /specialized module : refineries + an antenna for coordination mining ops
//Civilian Factory defined by string : "1" /specialized module : Fac that builds scouts and miners (perhaps scavengers as well)
//Stockpiles defined by string : "2" /specialized module : Better Cargo + more entry points + point defenses
//Small Military Factory defined by string : "3" /specialized module : Fac that builds fighters and small military ship
//Large Military Factory defined by string : "4" /specialized module : Fac that builds Large military Ships
//(not sure) Multi Comunication Relay defined by string : "5" /specialized module : Antenna Relays for fast communication 

//demand format :
//"object" of demand (ie iron, nickel, miners, scouts, soldiers, comms support, etc.); amount; demand quantifier
