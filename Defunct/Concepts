//Offer/Demand//

if one station receives to much demand : build another one (if ressources permit, otherwise send work elsewhere)

EXAMPLE :
Extratcion site,
Receives locations of nearby asteroids from scouts
if receives to many ressources :
-check demand level of Refineries 
 if HIGH :
  -build more transfer ships
 //need to get rid of these ressources
 if LOW : 
  -build new extractions site
 //Because extraction sites do not actually give more income (miners do), but give more inventory.
